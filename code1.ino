Robot Motors Direction Tests
 This test makes sure we get all four of the motor dirction pins correct
 Keep changing these numbers until you get it right directions for each wheel
 Use the serial monitor to verify which one should be working
 Note, On the Arduino Nano, only pins 3,5,6,9,10 and 11 have PWM output.  You must use these to drive the motors.
 See https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardNano

 The convention is to use the first four pins (3,5,6,9) for the motor controls
 If you use a ribbon connector the order will be 5,3,6 and 9
